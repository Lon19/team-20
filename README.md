## Plan:
### Goal outline:
1) Get data
2) Process data
3) Present data

### Potential future features:
- Droppable pins: this feature would allow the user to display work centers, businesses and self-plottable points.
- Filtering data: this function would allow the user to select which data they want displayed. The categories that we would offer are age{18-24; 25-29; Both},date{in format Month, Year}, gender{Male;Female;Both}
- Distance between dropped pin and postcode: this feature would enable the user to identify the distance from their ideal location to the zone of high youth unemployment. This feature is useful as it will allow the employer to determine whether the location of his business setup will be accessible via car travel.
- Distance between dropped pin and postcode by public transport: extention on the feature above where we would calculate the public transport travel time.
- Timeline: this would enable user to drag a slider which would show the changes of unemployment in certain areas. This feature could be used for predicting trends in unemployment in future.
